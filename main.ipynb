        "\n",
        "### **🔹  Why This Approach?**\n",
        "- I chose this method because I am more familiar with OpenAI’s API and its ability to analyze text.\n",
        "-  While similar results might be achieved using NLP libraries like NLTK, I decided to go for an approach I was more comfortable with. I'm interested in learning NLTK in the future though!\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3️⃣ Limitations**\n",
        "🚧 While this method works well for the given loan agreements, I haven't tested it on a broader set of **8-K Forms**. Some challenges may include:\n",
        "- **Text Formatting Variations** → Some documents may use slightly different phrasing.\n",
        "- **Multi-line Keyword Issues** →  The target phrases sometimes break across multiple lines, making them harder to find. I encountered this issue with the signature phrase and had to adjust it to a shorter version to ensure that it worked.\n",
        "- **Varying Section Lengths** → Signature details are relatively similar in length, but borrower/lender details can vary a lot. Some documents contain much longer lender/amount sections, so the character limit may need to be increased if extracted information appears incomplete.\n",
        "- **Cost Considerations** → Frequent API calls can add up costs over time. It might be better to use gpt-3.5-turbo to save on costs.\n",
